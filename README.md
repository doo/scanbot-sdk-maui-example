# Example app for the Scanbot Document Scanner SDK and Data Capture Modules for .NET MAUI

This example app shows how to integrate the [Scanbot Document Scanner SDK](https://scanbot.io/document-scanner-sdk/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites) and [Scanbot Data Capture Modules](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites) for MAUI and .NET.

## What is the Scanbot SDK?

The Scanbot SDK is a set of high-level APIs that lets you integrate document scanning as well as data extraction functionalities into your mobile apps and websites. It runs on all common mobile devices and operates entirely offline on the user's mobile device. No data is transmitted to our or third-party servers.

The SDK can be integrated into your app within minutes and comes with Ready-To-Use UI components. These allow you to customize the scanner to your needs and ensure full functionality. 

üí° For more details about the Scanbot Document Scanner SDK and Data Capture Modules, please check out our¬†[documentation](https://docs.scanbot.io/document-scanner-sdk/maui/introduction/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites).

## How to run this example app?

### Requirements

[Microsoft Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/) Developing native, cross-platform .NET Multi-platform App UI (.NET MAUI) apps requires Visual Studio 2022 17.3 or greater, or Visual Studio 2022 for Mac 17.4 or greater.

### Build Instructions

Assuming you already have your development machine setup, the following commands will help you build and debug our projects:

#### .NET

##### iOS

To build the iOS example project for both net7.0-ios and net8.0-ios, forcing packages to be restored and everything to be compiled from scratch:

`dotnet build NET/ReadyToUseUI.iOS --force --no-incremental -r ios-arm64`

To run the project on a real device, specify a target framework with `-f net8.0-ios` and the Run target via `-t:Run`, yielding the following:

`dotnet build NET/ReadyToUseUI.iOS -r ios-arm64 -f net8.0-ios -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

The Classic Component has its own project. Run it with:

`dotnet build NET/ClassicComponent.iOS -r ios-arm64 -f net8.0-ios -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

##### Android

To build the Android example project for both net7.0-android and net8.0-android, forcing packages to be restored and everything to be compiled from scratch:

`dotnet build NET/ReadyToUseUI.Droid --force --no-incremental`

To run the project on a real device, specify a target framework with `-f net8.0-android` and the Run target via `-t:Run`, yielding the following:

`dotnet build NET/ReadyToUseUI.Droid -f net8.0-android -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

The Classic Component has its own project. Run it with:

`dotnet build NET/ClassicComponent.Droid -f net8.0-android -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

#### MAUI

To build the MAUI example project for all supported target frameworks (net7.0-android, net7.0-ios, net8.0-android and net8.0-ios) and forcing packages to be restored and everything to be compiled from scratch, execute:

`dotnet build MAUI/ReadyToUseUI.Maui --force --no-incremental`

To run the project on a real iOS device, specify a target framework with `-f net8.0-ios` and the Run target via `-t:Run`, yielding the following:

`dotnet build MAUI/ReadyToUseUI.Maui -f net8.0-ios -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

To run the project on a real Android device, specify a target framework with `-f net8.0-android` and the Run target via `-t:Run`, yielding the following:

`dotnet build MAUI/ReadyToUseUI.Maui -f net8.0-android -t:Run --force --no-incremental`

## Overview of the Scanbot SDK

### Document Scanner SDK

The Scanbot .NET MAUI Document Scanning SDK offers the following key features:

* **User guidance**: Ease of use is crucial for large user bases. Our on-screen user guidance helps even non-tech-savvy users create high-quality scans. The SDK provides a consistent user interface that ensures a smooth and intuitive experience for all users.

* **Automatic capture**: The SDK automatically captures the scan when the device is optimally positioned over the document. This reduces the risk of blurry or incomplete scans from manual capture and ensures that the final images are suitable for further processing.¬†

* **Automatic cropping**: Our document scanning SDK automatically straightens and crops scanned documents, ensuring high-quality document scan results.

* **Custom filters:** Every use case has specific image requirements. With the SDK‚Äôs custom filters, you can turn the scanned images into optimal input for your backend systems.  They include grayscale options, multiple binarizations, and other settings to optimize your document scanning for various document types.

* **Document Quality Analyzer:** This feature automatically rates the quality of the scanned pages from ‚Äúvery poor‚Äù to ‚Äúexcellent.‚Äù If the quality is below a specified threshold, the SDK prompts the user to rescan.

* **Export formats:** The Scanbot .NET MAUI Document Scanner SDK supports various formats for exporting and image processing (JPG, PDF, TIFF, and PNG). This ensures your downstream solutions receive the best format to store, print, or share the digitized document ‚Äì or to process it further.

### Data Capture Modules

The Scanbot SDK Data Capture Modules allow you to extract data from a wide range of structured documents and to integrate OCR text recognition capabilities. They include:

#### [MRZ Scanner](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/mrz-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites) 
This module allows quick and accurate data extraction from the machine-readable zones on identity documents. It captures all important MRZ data from IDs and passports and returns it in the form of simple key-value pairs. This is much simpler, faster, and less mistake-prone than manual data entry.

#### [Check Scanner (MICR)](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/check-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites)
The MICR Scanner offers reliable data extraction from international paper checks, capturing check numbers, routing numbers, and account numbers from MICR codes. This simplifies workflows and reduces errors that frustrate customers and employees.

#### [Text Pattern Scanner](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/data-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites)
Our Text Pattern Scanner allows quick and accurate extraction of single-line data. It captures information based on customizable patterns tailored to your specific use case. This replaces error-prone manual data entry with automatic capture.

#### [VIN Scanner](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/vin-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites)
The VIN scanner enables instant capture of vehicle identification numbers (VINs) from trucks or car doors. It uses OCR to convert the image of the VIN code into structured data for backend processing. This module integrates into mobile or web-based fleet management applications, enabling you to replace error-prone manual entry with fast, reliable data extraction.

#### Document Data Extractor
Through this feature, our SDK offers document detection and data capture capabilities for a wider range of documents. It accurately identifies and crops various standardized document types, including [German ID cards](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/id-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites), passports, [driver's licenses](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/german-drivers-license-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites), [residence permits](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/residence-permit-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites), and the [EHIC](https://scanbot.io/data-capture-software/ehic-scanner/?utm_source=github.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=dev_sites). It uses the Scanbot OCR engine for accurate data field recognition, without requiring additional OCR language files.
